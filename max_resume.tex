%%%%%%  CV STARTS HERE  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% No personal projects -- this is a huge red flag that you can't program, add some github links & key points about your projects

% Semi-irrelevant work experience -- lots of people have done highschool jobs, you probably only need one of those three listed, use the rest for demonstrations of your ability to program (e.g., even 207 project is better than office assistant)

% Extra-Curriculars are good, too many words in that section, it should be bullets

% Verb tense is weird, use action words "I restructured and grew the club to more than 20 participating members." is an accomplishment that is easier to digest than a wall of text

% "Arduino's C" is weird, just put "C"
% "LaTeX" is not a programming language
% "Unix command line" is weird, you probably want "Linux administration experience" or something along those lines
